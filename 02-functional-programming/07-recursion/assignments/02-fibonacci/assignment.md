# Task

Implement a recursive method `fibonacci(number)` that returns the number-th fibonacci number
calculates (see https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rij_van_Fibonacci). Presumably
you will find a simple and short version that is, however, very inefficient. Can you explain why?

## Example
fibonacci(0) --> 0

fibonacci(3) --> 2

fibonacci(-5) --> 0
