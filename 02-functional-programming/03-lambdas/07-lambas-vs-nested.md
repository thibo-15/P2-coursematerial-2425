## Lambdas vs nested functions
Fundamentally, lambda functions are a type of nested functions, as they are defined in the scope they are used in. This
is why in most cases you would used a nested function, you can use a lambda function instead.

Lambda functions are therefore used in two different situations:
- situations where you **need** a nested function
- situations where you don't necessarily need a nested function, but you just want to create a one-line, anonymous
  function that you're only going to use this one time
