## Task

Write the following functions, relying on lambdas and on the helper classes/functions provided in `util.py`:

* `group_by_suit(cards)` groups `cards` by their suit.
* `group_by_value(cards)` groups `cards` by their value.
* `partition_by_color(cards)` splits `cards` into two lists: the first list contains only black cards, the second list only red cards.
  The color of a card is determined by its suit: spades and clubs are black, hearts and diamonds are red.
