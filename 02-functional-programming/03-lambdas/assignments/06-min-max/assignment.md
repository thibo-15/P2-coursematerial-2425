## Task

Write a function `closest(points, target_point)`.

* `points`: a list of points.
* `target_point`: a point.

The function should return the point from `points` that is closest to `target_point`.
In case of a tie, return the point that occurs first in the list.

Points are represented by pairs `(x, y)`.
The distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` equals `((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5`.
