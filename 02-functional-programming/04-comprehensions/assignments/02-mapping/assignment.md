## Tasks

The file `movie.py` (which you'll find not in this exercise's directory but one directory up) defines the class `Movie`.
Its attributes are

* title
* runtime
* director
* actors
* year
* genres

Write the following functions, many of which operate on a list of `Movie` objects:

* `titles(movies)` returns the movie titles.
* `titles_and_years(movies)` returns the movie titles and their year, grouped in pairs: `[(title1, year1), (title2, year2), ...]`.
* `titles_and_actor_counts(movies)` returns the movie titles paired up with the number of actors.
* `reverse_words(sentence)` must reverse each word in the given string `sentence`.
  Words are separated by one space.
